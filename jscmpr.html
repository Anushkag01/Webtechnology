For example, the word "apple" comes before "banana" because "a" comes before "b" in the alphabet.
same way
"1" comes before "11" because "1" is compared to "1" first,
 and they are the same, so the next character "1" in "11" is considered.
"2" comes after "11" because when comparing "1" and "2", "2" is greater.
"5" comes after "23" because the first character "5" is greater than "2"
